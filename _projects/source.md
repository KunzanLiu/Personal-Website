## Introduction

Capturing the metabolic dynamics of intact and living biosystems is essential in biomedicine from fundamental research to clinical pathology. Label-free two-photon autofluorescence (2PAF) imaging of NAD(P)H and FAD enables non-destructive, high-resolution, and three-dimensional visualization and characterization of cellular metabolic activities. The use of two-photon (2P) excitation of NAD(P)H imaging has been adopted in major tissue types and diseases for non-invasive assessment of oxidative phosphorylation and glucose catabolism in living cells.
However, NAD(P)H imaging rarely extends beyond 300 $$\mu$$m due to light scattering and out-of-focus background. Compared to the widely adopted 2P-based labeled imaging, this problem of limited depth pen- etration in NAD(P)H imaging is exacerbated by two intrinsic properties of NAD(P)H autofluorophore:
1. 2P cross-section of NAD(P)H is approximately 4 orders of magnitude lower than the commonly used labels such as GFPs (10$$^{-2}$$ GM compared to 10$$^2$$ GM of Calcium Crimson with Ca$$^{2+}$$).
2. The excited electronic states of NAD(P)H require more blue-shifted excitation wavelengths compared to existing markers ($$\sim$$750 nm for NAD(P)H compared to $$\sim$$930 nm for GFP), leading to increased scattering in deep tissue.
