## Introduction

Capturing the metabolic dynamics of intact and living biosystems is essential in biomedicine from fundamental research to clinical pathology. Label-free two-photon autofluorescence (2PAF) imaging of NAD(P)H and FAD enables non-destructive, high-resolution, and three-dimensional visualization and characterization of cellular metabolic activities. The use of two-photon (2P) excitation of NAD(P)H imaging has been adopted in major tissue types and diseases for non-invasive assessment of oxidative phosphorylation and glucose catabolism in living cells. However, NAD(P)H imaging rarely extends beyond 300 $$\mu$$m due to light scattering and out-of-focus background.

In this work, we demonstrate the depth limit of NAD(P)H imaging can be significantly alleviated by adopting three-photon (3P) excitation of NAD(P)H at 1100 nm from a multimode fiber (MMF) source. In label-based imaging, it has been proposed and demonstrated that 3P excitation of fluorescent markers can significantly reduce scattering and enhance signal-to-background ratio (SBR) in deeper tissue. Nevertheless, this has not been successfully extended to label-free NAD(P)H imaging. One pragmatic technical challenge is the lack of existing commercial femtosecond sources near the band of 1100 nm with high peak power and decent beam quality. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using easily accessible MMFs for high-quality deep and dynamic metabolic and structural imaging of living biosystems.

Prior work, abbreviated as SLAM (simultaneous label-free autofluorescence-multiharmonic) imaging, demonstrated the possibility of using photonic crystal fiber (PCF)-based 1110-nm sources for 3P excitation of NAD(P)H (9). The introduction of 1110-nm excitation enabled simultaneous acquisition of third harmonic generation (THG) originating at the structural interfaces (20–22), together with the 3P excitation of NAD(P)H and 2P exci- tation of FAD, plus second harmonic generation (SHG) from collagen fibers (23, 24). The combination of these orthogonal contrasts allowed simultaneous visualization of diverse cellular and extracellular components in the unper- turbed tissue microenvironment (25–29). Nevertheless, it was not clear how deep SLAM can image into living tissues (the depth was limited to 200μm due to the energy constraint of excitation pulses) and how widely deployable SLAM could be for the general bioimaging field given the non-trivial PCF and pulse shaper setup.

In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the depth limit of NAD(P)H imaging can be extended to over 700μm, using living engineered human multicellular microtissues as test samples, and by adopting MMF-based low-repetition-rate high-peak-power 3P excitation of NAD(P)H at 1100nm, enabling deep and dynamic SLAM (dSLAM) imaging. The high peak power exceeding 0.5 MW at the band of 1100±25 nm was obtained by adaptively mod- ulating multimodal nonlinear pulse propagation with a compact fiber shaper (30). Furthermore, the 8-fold increase of pulse energy at 1100nm allows us to capture faster monocyte behaviors in the engineered human multicellu- lar microtissues in vitro. These results and findings represent an important advance towards deeper and faster metabolic and structural imaging of intact living biosystems. We anticipate the flexibility provided by the modular design (step-index (SI) MMF with a slip-on fiber shaper) will allow the proposed imaging methodology to be widely adopted for demanding in vivo and in vitro imaging applications (31), including cancer research (32–35), autoimmune diseases (36, 37), and tissue engineering (38, 39).
