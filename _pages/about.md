I am a second year graduate student at MIT EECS, working at Computational Biophotonics Laboratory advised by Prof. [Sixian You](https://www.rle.mit.edu/yougroup/). I work on designing optics and algorithms for label-free nonlinear microscopy to study complex multicellular dynamics.

I received my B.E. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2022, where I worked on dimensionality reduction for wireless communications with Prof. [Linglong Dai](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/dailinglong/).
