I am a third year graduate student at MIT EECS, working at Computational Biophotonics Laboratory advised by Prof. [Sixian You](https://www.rle.mit.edu/yougroup/). My research focuses on designing optics and algorithms for label-free nonlinear microscopy to study complex multicellular dynamics.

I received my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2024, where I worked with Prof. [Sixian You](https://www.rle.mit.edu/yougroup/) developing the deep and dynamic metabolic and structural imaging platform.
Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2022, where I worked on dimensionality reduction for wireless communications with Prof. [Linglong Dai](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/dailinglong/).
