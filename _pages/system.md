Understanding of complex diseases, therapeutic effects, and biological functions requires new imaging tools with minimal biological disruption, multiplexed molecular contrast in high volumes and high resolution. I build this label-free nonlinear microscope and work on designing optics and algorithms towards faster, deeper, and more colorful imaging for multicellular dynamics.

I collaborate closely with Prof. [Linda Griffith](https://lgglab.mit.edu/) from MIT BE studying human endometrium, Prof. [Eliezer Calo](https://www.calolab.mit.edu/) from MIT Biol studying nucleolus, and Dr. [Michal Tal](https://talresearchgroup.mit.edu/) from MIT BE studying bacteria infection in Lyme disease.
