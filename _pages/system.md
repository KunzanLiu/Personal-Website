Understanding of complex diseases, therapeutic effects, and biological functions requires new imaging tools with minimal biological disruption, multiplexed molecular contrast in high volumes and high resolution. I build this label-free multiphoton microscope and work on designing optics and algorithms towards faster, deeper, and more colorful imaging for multicellular dynamics.

I collaborate closely with Prof. [Linda Griffith](https://lgglab.mit.edu/) from MIT BE studying human endometrium and Prof. [Fan Wang](https://www.wanglab-neuro.org/) from MIT BCS studying mouse whisker pad.
