Understanding of complex diseases, therapeutic effects, and biological functions requires new imaging tools with minimal biological disruption, multiplexed molecular contrast in high volumes and high resolution. I build this label-free multiphoton microscope and work on designing optics and algorithms towards faster, deeper, and more colorful imaging for multicellular dynamics.
